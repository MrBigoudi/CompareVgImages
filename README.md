# CompareVgImages


## The project

</br>

CompareVgImages is a tool to help you compare [Vg.image](https://erratique.ch/software/vg/doc/Vg/I/index.html) in a more precise way than with only the [I.equal](https://erratique.ch/software/vg/doc/Vg/I/index.html#val-equal) function.

CompareVgImages is made to be used with [learn-OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-sf/learn-ocaml), a platform for learning the OCaml language, featuring a Web toplevel, an exercise environment, and a directory of lessons and tutorials.

However, it's utilisation will be more user-friendly with [easy-check](https://github.com/lsylvestre/easy-check), a tool to help you correct and grade exercices for the learn-OCaml platform.
