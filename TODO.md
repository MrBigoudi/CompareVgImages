## Compare Vg images

<br>


- Compare outline.

- Be less strict with translations, ie, two images which look alike but are at different positions should be considered as the same. 

- Add other type of constants (like b-curves ...).

<br>


## Other idea to compare images

<br>


### Vg images as bitmaps

- Try to implement a different version of the comparator that transform the Vg images into two bitmaps that we'll compare later.

- Use this new comparison technique to implement a <strong>compareGraphicsImages</strong> which compares two images from the Graphics module.

<br>


### Hu moments

- Try to use the Hu moment formula (cf [here](https://learnopencv.com/shape-matching-using-hu-moments-c-python/)) to compare Vg images

<br>


## Outside this module

- Try to update learnOcaml to show the student the expected image and their image after the correctiono instead of just writting '<abstr>'
