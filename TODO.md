# To do List

## Compare Vg images

- Compare colors.

- Compare outline.

- Add other type of constants (like b-curves ...).

## Vg images as bitmaps

- Try to implement a different version of the comparator that transform the Vg images to compare into two bitmaps that we'll compare later.

- Use this new comparison technique to implement a <strong>compareGraphicsImages</strong> which compares two images from the Graphics module.
